# CoHeal - Covid19 Help, Info & Tracker

## Problem Statement
CoHeal is a website that allows its users to communicate with the Microsoft Healthcare Bot service regarding Covid-19 queries through a Webchat interface, and helps the people to find Covid related information, displays Statistics of total cases and deaths per country using Microsoft azure web app services.

## Project Description
The Core idea of this project-"CoHeal" is to solve FAQ's of the people regarding the Covid-19 and help them out to solve their most common question & queries related to the Covid-19 with some of the suggestive methods using the "Microsoft Healthcare Bot service". In this unforeseen pandemic situation which was raised in the year 2019, there are many confusions & misconceptions about the virus among most of the people. Although there are many FAQ sections on the web, people find it difficult to get there and read them, and also they find it extremely difficult to log on to the websites and check for the required information. Also various social media platforms are misguiding people with divergent and inconsistent information. Thus, by this project, I aim to provide a very simple and user-friendly Bot service which provide answers through a simple Webchat interface. The Second major functionality of this project is Covid19 Live Cases Tracker, which tracks the Real-time live data of COVID-19 cases in each and every country globally (The website also provides the Realtime Recovery & Mortality Rate of each and every country in the world). The Third main functionality of this project is that the Website provides its users the reliable information about Covid Symptoms & Precautions, and also about Lifespan of Virus on various day to day objects we use. The project also provides a option through which the users can directly donate money to the PM CARES Fund if needed.
